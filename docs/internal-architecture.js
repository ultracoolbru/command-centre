/**
 * Documentation for the Command Dashboard
 *
 * This documentation provides an overview of the internal architecture,
 * module structure, and integration points for the Command Dashboard application.
 */

/**
 * Architecture Overview
 *
 * The Command Dashboard follows a modular architecture with the following key components:
 *
 * 1. Next.js App Router: Page-based routing with server components
 * 2. MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based data persistence
 * 3. Firebase Auth: User authentication and session management
 * 4. Gemini API: AI-powered insights and analysis
 * 5. Zustand: Client-side state management
 * 6. Mantine UI: Component library for consistent UI
 *
 * The application is designed to be modular, with each dashboard section
 * functioning as an independent module that can be extended or modified
 * without affecting other parts of the system.

/**
 * Data Flow
 *
 * 1. User Authentication:
 *    - User credentials → Firebase Auth → JWT token → Protected routes
 *
 * 2. Data Operations:
 *    - Client components → Custom hooks → API routes → MongoDB → Client state
 *
 * 3. AI Integration:
 *    - User data → Server-side API routes → Gemini API → Insights → Client display
 *
 * 4. Voice Input:
 *    - Browser Speech API → Voice hooks → Command processing → Action execution
 */

/**
 * Module Structure
 *
 * Each dashboard module follows a consistent pattern:
 *
 * 1. Page component: Main UI and layout
 * 2. Data fetching: Using custom hooks to interact with MongoDB
 * 3. State management: Local state + Zustand for persistence
 * 4. AI integration: Where applicable, using Gemini API
 * 5. Voice commands: Module-specific voice interactions
 */

/**
 * Extension Points
 *
 * The dashboard is designed to be extensible in the following ways:
 *
 * 1. New Modules:
 *    - Create a new directory in src/app/dashboard/
 *    - Implement page.tsx following the module pattern
 *    - Add navigation link in dashboard layout
 *
 * 2. New AI Features:
 *    - Extend src/lib/gemini.ts with new functions
 *    - Add corresponding API routes in src/app/api/gemini/
 *
 * 3. New Voice Commands:
 *    - Add command patterns to the module's command dictionary
 *    - Implement corresponding handler functions
 */

/**
 * Security Considerations
 *
 * 1. API Keys:
 *    - All sensitive keys stored in environment variables
 *    - Gemini API only accessible server-side
 *
 * 2. Authentication:
 *    - Firebase Auth with secure session management
 *    - Protected routes for all dashboard content
 *
 * 3. Data Privacy:
 *    - User data isolated by userId in MongoDB
 *    - Voice processing happens client-side only
 */

/**
 * Deployment Process
 *
 * The application uses a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:
 *
 * 1. Code pushed to main branch
 * 2. GitHub Actions runs tests and builds the application
 * 3. Docker image is created and pushed to registry
 * 4. Firebase deployment is triggered
 * 5. Application is live at command.edwardwhitehead.dev
